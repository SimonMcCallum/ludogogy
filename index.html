            <h2>Why Choose Ludogogy?</h2>
            <p>Dr McCallum works at multiple Universities,
                with 25 years of award winning lecturing experience in AI, Computer Science and 
                Game Development. He has worked in industry as a game developer,
                company founder, board member, and as a consultant.
            </p>
            <p>Ludogogy is one vehicle for helping people.
                If you are wanting research related to AI or game development
                then <a href="https://people.wgtn.ac.nz/simon.mccallum"> Victoria University of Wellington</a>, in NZ, or 
                <a href="https://www.ntnu.edu/employees/simon.mccallum">NTNU in Norway</a> are ways of enaging my services to
                run projects with PhD students,
                post-docs and the resources of Major Universities in NZ, Austrailia, or Norway.
            </p>
            <p>For projects that require a more agile
                and flexible approach, one which is more personal 
                and direct I use Ludogogy. This can provide the personal touch
                need by some businesses and organisations.
